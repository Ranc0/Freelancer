# Freelancing Platform â€“ Backend

A Django-powered backend for a freelancing application focused on small-scale services.  
This project was one of my earliest professional builds and served as a hands-on introduction to designing scalable backend systems from the ground up.

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
The platform enables seamless interaction between clients and freelancers, offering core freelancing marketplace features:
- **User Authentication** â€“ Secure registration, login, and profile management.
- **Service Listings** â€“ CRUD operations for posting and browsing services.
- **Ratings & Reviews** â€“ Feedback system to maintain service quality.
- **Messaging System** â€“ Direct communication between clients and freelancers.

## ðŸš€ Key Learnings
- Built many features manually before fully leveraging Djangoâ€™s built-in capabilities, which deepened my understanding of backend logic.  
- Gained experience in structuring maintainable codebases and optimizing workflow efficiency.  
- Learned to anticipate scalability needs and design with future growth in mind.

## ðŸ“ˆ Outcome
While not production-deployed, this project laid the foundation for my backend development practices, influencing how I approach architecture, performance, and maintainability in later projects.
